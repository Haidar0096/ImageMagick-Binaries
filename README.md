# ImageMagick-Binaries

This repository contains the compiled binaries for image magick library for different platforms.

For example, to get the `lib` files, `dll` files, and `include` directory of image magick for windows (x64), go to the x64 folder and copy the folders `bin` (for the dlls), `lib` (for the `lib` files), and `include` (for the `.h` and `.c`/`.cpp` files).

Details about the build configuration of each version of the binaries is available in the `README` file in the corresponding folder.

## Notes:
- The supported ImageMagick configs are Q8 (No HDRI), Q8 (with HDRI), Q16 (No HDRI), Q16 (with HDRI).
